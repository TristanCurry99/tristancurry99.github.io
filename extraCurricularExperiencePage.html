        <p> I began swimming competitively at the age of 6, and since then I have been training and competing alongside my academics ever since. Swimming has helped me develop many of my interpersonal, leadership, and communication skills.</p>

            <p> During my time on the University of Waterloo Varsity swim team, I was able to train, compete, and study mechatronics for all 5 years of my undergraduate degree. This commitment to athletics lead me to train on average 24 hours a week, with practices each morning requiring being on deck at 5:30 am each morning Monday to Saturday year round, included additional time in the weight room, and recovery activities such as yoga, ice baths, rolling, and physiotherapy. The amount of time committed to swimming allowed me to quickly develop time management skills, project and task planning, and effective use of task ranking. Swimming also allowed me to improve my leadership abilities, as I was voted Captain for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons. </p>
            <p> Swimming at Waterloo helped me learn the importance of continuous dedication, effort, and persistance. Many seasons I set goals for myself that I knew would be hard to obtain, but I none the less, aspired and worked towards at each practice. Focusing on improving my weaknesses when opportunities arose, such as underwater kicks off walls, improving my flexibility, and my aerobic capacity. These areas of weakness required consistent, continual, hard work, but had massive payoffs when racing season began in the early winter.</p>
            <p> During my time at Waterloo, Covid-19 lockdowns began at the end of my 3rd season. This time marked the beginning of a time where social distancing, limited the possible interactions, training, and team events that could be done safely. In an effort to keep team moral high during this period of time where in person meetings were not possible, we endeavored to re-create team traditions online. Leading to games nights, social hours, and training together over zoom meetings. This period also marked a shift in training, as less practice time, and space, was available. This lead to individual training, often in the form of running, biking, and calisthetics, when a pool was not available. This time period allowed me to self-reflect and reminded me the joys of sport, and the opportunities that came with it. </p>

        <div class="contentText">
            <p> In my final year of academics at Waterloo, I had decicded to continue my studies at the University of Western Ontario, studying Electrical and Computer engineering, with this in mind I began to train with a renewed vigor, as many of the covid restrictions had began to be lifted, and not knowing what the future of my career would look like. The last season with Waterloo saw many highs, including a mens team 2nd place finish at the OUA championships, a podium finish for me and my teammates in the 4x100m medley relay, and personal bests in all of my races, including large time drops in my best events.</p>
            <p> With my time at Waterloo complete I was fortunate enough to have a year of eligibilty remaining for varsity athletics. With this I began to train with Western the following September, where my sprinting ability and work ethic, combined with a new training plan and group, helped push me to new heights. In my first 12 weeks with Western, I was able to qualify for the USports National Championships, the first time I reached this milestone. Additionally, I was able to improve across all areas of swimming, from technique to aerobic capacity. This new chapter in my career led me to push harder in practice, and aim higher in my goals.</p>
            <p> My first year with Western culminated in qualifying for the 2023 Canadian World Championship Trials, another first in my career. With the first season concluded, I had also acheived Academic all-Canadian status, for my acheivements in the pool, and in Academics. </p>
            <p> For my second and final year with Western I had one goal in mind, qualifying for the 2024 Olympic Trials event in Toronto. This meet is the pinacle of national swimming in Canada, and is the only chance athletes have to qualify for the Olympics. Throughout the season I was able to improve my Long course swimming abilities, my backend speed and endurance and technique. Although I was unable to qualify for Trials, missing the cutoff time by 0.2 seconds, the journey to my final meet for the year was marked with fond memories, excitement, and learning just how committed to goals I can be. My attendance at practice, was perfect, I consistently created opportunities to push myself beyond my limit, and consistently performed at the highest level in the team. This season was the culmination of decades of practice, and I enjoyed the journey the entire way.</p>
            <p> With my time at Western Varsity completed, I continue to swim, although much more casually now. I love the sport, the community and the opportunities it presents at each practice.</p>

        <p> During my time at Waterloo, I Volunteered with the Orientation committee, volunteering for several years as a big, huge, and EdCom leader. In these roles I took on different resonsibilities, including event planning and execution, interaction with incoming first years, communication, and even a little bit of acting.</p>

        <div class="contentText">
            <p> My first time volunteering as an Orientation leader, a big, gave me the responsibilities of directly interacting with the first years, encouraging them during team events, and creating a welcoming environment where they can learn the campus, the community, and engineering traditions in a safe and inclusive space. </p>
            <p> My second year volunteering, as a Huge this time, allowed me to take on a more planning oriented and leadership role. Huges are responsible for the entire team of first years and bigs, ensuring the schedule is running as expected, and interacting with EdCom, the antagonists of the week. In  addition I took on responsibilities of planning and acquiring the neccessary items for the "Ask Me" help booths located in the engineering quad. These responsibilities and opportunities helped me better my communication and planning skills.</p>
            <p> My final year volunteering for Orientation week was as an EdCom. These leaders are tasked with running events, and interacting with the other Huges and Bigs to create comical events for the first years to witness. Acting as a deadpan, no-nonsense antagonist allowed for comical interactions, smooth communication on event participation, and being able to go outside my comfort zone when interacting and performing planned skits with leaders.</p>
            <p> Additionally, as this year was heavily online due to covid, I helped create many of the online activities, such as games in Minecraft education eddition, and other online interactive games. I also helped set up and run the Eng concert event at the end of the week.</p>
